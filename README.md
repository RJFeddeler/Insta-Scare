# InstaScare

Insta Scare is an iOS app I coded in Objective-C using XCode and was in the App Store in 2011. It was coded in XCode 4.x and targeted for iOS 5.0.  It is a prank app that is designed to scare your victim by showing a scary image and playing a loud frightening sound after luring him/her to the iPhone/iPod Touch.

Different methods of attracting the victim include: asking him/her to get your iPhone/iPod Touch for you and the motion and/or touch of picking up the phone sets it off, a custom message can pop up after a set interval to get him/her to click on it, and there is also a mode in which random creepy sounds are played at a random interval for a duration of time until the device is found and a final scare is triggered  (great for sleep overs!).

I recorded a video showcasing the app using the XCode iOS Simulator.  The video can be found on YouTube at:
